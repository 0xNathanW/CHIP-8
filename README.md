# CHIP-8 emulator built in Go

Mainly built to build understanding of computer arcitechture, specifically the CPU.  The Chip-8 is probabably the easiest emulator to build, with only 35 opcodes.  It was developed as an interpreted programming language to allow games to be more easily programmed on early 10970's machines.
