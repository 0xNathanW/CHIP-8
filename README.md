# **CHIP-8 Emulator Built in Go**

Mainly built to build understanding of computer arcitechture, specifically the CPU.  The Chip-8 is probabably the easiest emulator to build, with only 35 opcodes.  It was developed as an interpreted programming language to allow games to be more easily programmed on early 1970's machines.
